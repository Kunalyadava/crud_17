<!-- In Angular forms, the concept of "dirty" is used to track whether a form control or
form group has been modified by the user. Here's an explanation of what it means and how it works:

What Does "Dirty" Mean?
Dirty: A form control or form group becomes dirty when the user has changed its value at least once.
 This state is used to determine if the user has interacted with the form and made changes.
Pristine: The opposite of dirty. A form control or form group is pristine when it has not 
been modified by the user since it was initialized or reset.

Why is "Dirty" Important?
Tracking the dirty state is useful for:

Validation Feedback: Showing validation messages only after the user has 
interacted with the form field, preventing the display of error messages for untouched fields.
Form Submission: Determining if the form has been changed and requires saving, particularly
in cases where you might want to prevent unnecessary submissions of unchanged forms.
UI Behavior: Triggering specific UI behaviors, such as enabling or 
disabling buttons based on whether any changes have been made. -->

<!-- When the invalid property of a form control is true, it indicates that 
the current value of the control does not pass all of its validators' checks. 

Hereâ€™s an explanation of what each property means in the context of your Angular form control (name):

Controls: This likely refers to the form controls within your Angular form group. 
In your case, email and name are two form controls.

Errors: This property is null, indicating that there are currently no 
validation errors on the name control.

Pristine: This property is false, meaning that the value of the name 
control has been changed from its initial state.

Status: The status is "INVALID", indicating that the current value of 
the name control is not considered valid based on its validators.

Touched: This property is true, indicating that the name control has 
been blurred (focused and then unfocused), which typically triggers 
showing validation errors if the control is invalid.

Value: The value of the name control is { email: '', name: 'bvcxbcx' }, 
where 'bvcxbcx' is the current input value.

Explanation of invalid: true
The invalid: true property indicates that the name control does not meet 
the validation criteria defined for it. This validation could be due 
to various reasons depending on the validators applied:

Required Validator: If Validators.required is applied to the name 
control, it would be invalid if the field is empty ('').

Pattern Validator: If a Validators.pattern validator is applied, 
the control would be invalid if the value doesn't match the specified pattern.

In your case, since the errors property is null, there are no specific validation 
errors reported. However, the control's overall status is still "INVALID", 
indicating that some validators (possibly Validators.required or others) 
have determined the current value ('bvcxbcx') to be invalid. -->
